1. Integrate basic theme to asset pipeline -- static theme
2. Allow people to CRUD lists. People should be able to create lists and then they should be able to add, navigate, see items. Need lists and items models (has_many, belongs_to)
#index to see their lists and also to double as #new action since I present users with a form to create a new list
#show a list

So, we need a model and constroller -- resource generator
